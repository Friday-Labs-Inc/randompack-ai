"""
The Studio Workspace endpoints (design 96, Pillar 3 — "The Bench").

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
The human Creative Director's work queue used to be invisible: the only signal
was a Raven war-room post, and acting meant finding the right Brand Brief form
and knowing which workflow button to press. These three endpoints power the
`/app/studio` Desk page that fixes that:

  - ``studio_snapshot``  — every Brand Brief waiting on the CD (the two CD_ROLE
                            states from the design-95 machine), as queue cards:
                            brand name, state, days waiting, package/round counts.
  - ``package_preview``  — the thing to review: every production-package version
                            on the brief's project rendered md→html, newest first,
                            so refine rounds can be compared side by side.
  - ``studio_action``    — the one-click verbs: Creative Ready / Approve
                            Production / Request Refinement. Refinement REQUIRES
                            notes; they are written to the project as
                            ``cd-refinement-notes-r<N>.md`` BEFORE the transition
                            fires, so the production agent finds them the moment
                            its phase starts. The notes are also the design-95
                            apprenticeship training signal.

Transitions run through ``frappe.model.workflow.apply_workflow`` as the
signed-in user, so the workflow's own role gate (`Brand Creative Director`)
is the enforcement — these endpoints add no parallel permission scheme.

Compare with Hermes: no equivalent — Hermes has no human-in-the-loop craft
station; its dashboard is operator telemetry. The Bench is a reviewer surface,
which is exactly the design-95 divergence (human CD creates, AI produces).
