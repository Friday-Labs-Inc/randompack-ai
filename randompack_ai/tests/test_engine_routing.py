"""
Routing + flow tests for the Design 75 metadata engine.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
These prove the engine's two core moves, with no LLM and nothing committed:

  - DISPATCH BY METADATA: saving a work-item into an agentic state creates a
    Task assigned to the profile whose discriminator_role matches the
    transition's agent_role (O(1) routing, not skill-subset guessing).
  - AUTO-ADVANCE: when that Task completes, the work-item advances to the next
    state and the next phase's Task is dispatched to the next owner — the chain
    flows on its own.
  - A human-gate state dispatches nothing.

The runner is stubbed so a dispatched (Assigned) task never runs; we instead
mark the task Completed by hand to drive the advance, which is exactly what the
real runner would do after the agent's turn. The advance enqueue runs
synchronously under `frappe.flags.in_test`, so the chain is observable in-test.
