"""
The CD apprenticeship study loop (design 95, Slice 2).

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
The founder's vision, verbatim: "the creative director agent slowly should
study and learn from human director feeds, once its confident we can allow it
to create logo and brandings." This module is the STUDY half: it watches the
two places the human Creative Director's taste shows up, and turns each into
durable Agent Memory for the apprentice (the "Creative Director" agent profile):

1. **Observation (CD Creative → onwards).** When the human fires Creative
   Ready, the apprentice gets an *observe task*: read the brief and the
   human's uploaded artifacts (design system, boards) and `remember` 1–3
   structured lessons — "given this brief, he chose {palette, type, logo
   route}". No judgment, just pairing. The task is a side-study: it carries
   NO work_item link, so it can never advance the pipeline (engine/advance.py
   ignores tasks without work_item fields) and never crosses the RandomPack
   seam (the bridge writeback keys on the work-item).

2. **Labeled feedback (CD Internal Gate decisions).** Every gate decision on
   the AI's production is a labeled example, recorded DIRECTLY (no model
   call — cheap and honest): Approve Production = a positive label; Request
   Refinement = the correction, quoting the cd-refinement-notes file the
   Studio Bench just wrote (studio_api saves it BEFORE the transition, so it
   is always there on this path).

Memories are tagged via `subject="cd-apprentice"` so future recall and the
Slice-3 confidence ledger can find and count them.

Wired in hooks.py as a third Brand Brief on_update handler (after the engine
and the bridge). Failure-isolated: a study outage must NEVER break a
workflow save — every entry point is wrapped.

Compare with Hermes: no equivalent — Hermes agents have session memory but no
observational apprenticeship channel. This is the Design 95 divergence: taste
is accumulated from a human's real decisions, not prompt-engineered.
