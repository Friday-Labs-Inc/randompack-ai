"""
Governance tests for the Design 75 metadata engine — the load-bearing bit.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
The single most important property of the engine is that role-gating on a
workflow transition is REAL even inside a background worker. Frappe waves
`Administrator` through every transition, and a worker's session IS
Administrator — so the engine must switch to the acting user before firing a
transition (engine.governance.acting_as). These tests prove:

  - an agent CANNOT fire a transition it doesn't own (wrong agent) — raises,
  - an agent CANNOT open a human client gate — raises,
  - the gateway account (which holds only the gate role) CAN open the gate,
  - two Active profiles cannot share a discriminator_role (loud, not silent).

They reuse the provisioned `randompack-brand` bundle and roll everything back —
nothing is committed, and the runner is stubbed so no LLM is ever called.
