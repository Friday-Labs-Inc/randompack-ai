"""RandomPack project chat — the authenticated portal's project advisor surface.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
After a customer buys, their portal shows their Project — its phases, deliverables, and
the two decision gates. This surface is the AI advisor that sits next to that timeline:
the customer discusses the project ("what do the three directions mean for a premium
brand?") and, when they express a gate decision in chat ("lock direction B"), Friday
PROPOSES the action as a structured event. RandomPack renders a one-tap confirm card and
— only on the human's tap — executes the actual gate decision on its side.

THE TRUST BOUNDARY (locked with RandomPack): Friday proposes, the human confirms, RP
executes. This surface NEVER fires `decide_gate` or any irreversible business action.
Defence-in-depth on top: every proposed action is validated against the action schema
AND the currently-open gate from RP's per-turn context — a hallucinated or out-of-context
proposal (a Gate 2 action while Gate 1 is open, an unknown direction label) is dropped
before it can reach the confirm card.

Topology mirrors the intake surface (CONTRACT §4): browser ── RP portal (authenticated
Website User) ── signed HMAC ── this endpoint. The customer's authentication/authorization
is RandomPack's concern (they only send context for projects the caller owns); the HMAC
seam is the RP↔Friday trust. Friday treats the signed `context` as ground truth.

ENDPOINT (whitelisted, guest — the HMAC signature IS the auth; the "guest" is RP's server)
  * `chat_send` — POST {session_id, message, context} → an SSE stream:
                    {type:"token", text}                 (live reply, <think> hidden)
                    {type:"action", kind, gate, decision, direction?, note, confidence}
                    {type:"done"}  |  {type:"error", error}

Built on the shared streaming spine (`surfaces/chat_spine.py`) — HMAC, SSE, the <think>
filter, the worker-thread streaming, transcript + usage audit + the explicit commit, and
platform registration are all inherited, not copied.

	"has bought a branding engagement; you can see their project's live state below. Discuss "
	"the project warmly and concretely: explain phases, deliverables, and what the gates mean; "
	"help them reason about decisions anchored on THEIR brief — their brand personality, "
	"differentiator, and audience. Keep replies short and conversational (2-4 sentences); one "
	"focused question at most.\n\n"
	"AUTHORITY: you have NONE to execute decisions. You may help the customer decide and, when "
	"they clearly express a gate decision, it will be proposed back to them as a confirmation "
	"card — the decision only happens when THEY confirm it. Never claim you have approved, "
	"locked, or submitted anything; say they'll be asked to confirm.\n\n"
	"IMPORTANT — direction content: you only know the direction LABELS (A/B/C). The actual "
	"visual content of each direction lives in the customer's delivered 'Three Directions' "
	"document. NEVER invent or describe a direction's specific visuals, colours, or fonts. "
	"Reason instead from their brief (personality, differentiator, audience) about what to "
	"look for when choosing, and refer them to their directions document for the visuals.\n\n"
	"RandomPack serves every lawful business. NEVER refuse, judge, or moralise about the "
	"customer's brand or industry. Always reply."
