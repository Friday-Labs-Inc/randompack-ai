"""
The RandomPack brand identity domain, expressed purely as DATA (Design 75).

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============
This is the FIRST domain bundle. It does NOT contain pipeline logic — that lives
in the generic engine (friday_core/engine/). What it contains is the *data* that
teaches the engine one domain:

  - a Frappe Workflow on the Brand Brief work-item: the states a job moves
    through (Strategy -> Naming -> ... -> Delivered) and the role-gated
    transitions between them,
  - a Friday Workflow Transition Meta row for every AGENTIC transition: which
    role owns it, which skills it verifies, and the Jinja prompt the agent runs,
  - the brand specialist team as Agent Profiles, each tagged with the
    discriminator_role the engine routes to,
  - a gateway service account that holds ONLY the client-gate role, so the two
    client decision gates can be fired (by a human in Desk, or by the RandomPack
    webhook) without any agent being able to approve its own work,
  - the Domain Bundle manifest tying it all together.

Add a second domain (data centre ops, research) the same way: more data, no new
Python. This module is a "fixture generator" (Design 75 §6) — the old
hardcoded RANDOMPACK_PIPELINE list is reborn here as Workflow + meta rows.

Run once per site (idempotent):

    bench --site friday.localhost execute \\
        randompack_ai.domains.randompack_brand.provision

Phase 1 is sequential-only (Design 75 §8): the historical naming/directions
fan-out is linearised. A true parallel fan-out is Phase 2.

DESIGN 95 (the CD apprenticeship) reshaped the machine: the HUMAN Creative
Director creates the identity (the CD Creative stage — he uploads his direction
options + design system to the Project and fires "Creative Ready"), the AI
applies it (AI Production), and his CD Internal Gate approves or loops the
production back for rework before anything reaches the client gates. The old
AI-originates-directions states (Directions, Buildout) remain as LEGACY so
in-flight briefs finish; no new brief enters them.
