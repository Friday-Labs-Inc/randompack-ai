"""RandomPack chat-intake surface — the wire for Friday's streaming front-door.

Topology (CONTRACT.md §4): browser ──SSE── RandomPack `chat_*` ──signed SSE── these
endpoints. The browser never talks to Friday directly; RandomPack proxies, signing each
call with the SAME HMAC seam as connector events (`X-RP-Signature`, the
`randompack-system` Connector's secret). This module turns one customer message into a
live streamed reply + structured wizard deltas, on top of the shared streaming spine
(`surfaces/chat_spine.py`) and `conversation/intake.py`.

CHAT-FIRST (CONTRACT §4.8): the chat is the ENTIRE intake — no wizard steps. RandomPack
sends a per-turn `context` naming the fields the brief still lacks
(`missing_required` / `missing_questionnaire`); the assistant interviews toward them,
one question per turn, and closes with "Review & pay" when both lists are empty.

ENDPOINTS (whitelisted, guest — the HMAC signature IS the auth)
  * `chat_send`     — POST {session_id, message, context?} → an SSE stream:
                        {type:"token", text}        (live reply, <think> blocks hidden)
                        {type:"delta", step, field, value, confidence}  (wizard pre-fill)
                        {type:"done"}  |  {type:"error", error}
  * `chat_finalize` — POST {session_id} → a final full-transcript extraction pass,
                        returns {session_id, deltas:[...]} as JSON (RandomPack writes the
                        draft brief + owns the account step — provisional, not here).

DELIBERATELY NOT HERE (CONTRACT.md §4.6): no `patch_brief` callback (deltas return
in-band), no `chat.*` outbox events (chat is live request/response, not the async fact
outbox). The 3 never-touch fields (password / gate_commitment / terms_accepted) are not
in the extraction vocabulary at all, so they can never be emitted as deltas.

This module keeps only intake MEANING (the vocabulary, the interview prompt, the delta
pass); the streaming/auth/persistence/audit plumbing is the shared spine — so fixes to
the hard parts (the post-auto-commit audit trail, platform registration, the anti-blank
guard) land once and apply to every chat surface.
